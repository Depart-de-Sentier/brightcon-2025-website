      <p>
        You can submit your own Brightcon 2025 idea for an interactive session:
        workshop, presentation, poster, you name it.
      </p>
      <!--
	      <p>This yearâ€™s theme is "Innovating Open Sustainability."</p>
      -->
      <p>
        We invite submissions for talks, demonstrations, workshops, posters, and
        special sessions that highlight the integration of software development
        and sustainability. We encourage contributions from domains such as LCA,
        MFA, IO, and Industrial Ecology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Show us how you have applied open source tools in your industry or
        research project, introduce a novel open source tool for sustainability
        to us which you have developed, or showcase a new library/package which
        could be useful for others.
      </p>

      <p>
        We especially want to invite contributions from online attendees of the
        conference.
